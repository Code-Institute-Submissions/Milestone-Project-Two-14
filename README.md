<h2>Design</h2>

<p>Inspiration for the game came from <a href="https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">The Big Bang Theory</a>. In the episode <a href="https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lizard-Spock_Expansion" rel="nofollow">The Lizard-Spock Expansion</a> Sheldon, Raj and Leonard are arguing about what to watch on TV, Raj suggests rock, paper, scissors. Sheldon says there is too much chance of a tie, and suggests Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock.</p>

<h2>Wireframes</h2>

<p>The Wireframes were created using <a href="https://wireframesketcher.com/" rel="nofollow">wireframesketcher</a> a powerful desktop wire framing tool.</p>

<h2>Feature</h2>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>For testing documentation please refer to the <a href="Testing.md" rel="nofollow">Testing markdown</a></p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>

<h3>GitHub Pages</h3>

<p>The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...</p>

<ol>
    <li>Log in to GitHub and locate the <a href="https://github.com/Darian-Frey/Milestone-Project-Two" rel="nofollow">GitHub Repository</a></li>
    <li>At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.<br>
        - Alternatively Click <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/" rel="nofollow">Here</a> for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.</li>
    <li>Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.</li>
    <li>Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".</li>
    <li>The page will automatically refresh.</li>
    <li>Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site <a href="https://github.com" rel="nofollow">Link</a> in the "GitHub Pages" section.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Forking the GitHub Repository</h3>

<p>By forking the GitHub Repository you make a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...</p>

<ol>
    <li>Log in to GitHub and locate the 1. Log in to GitHub and locate the <a href="https://github.com/Darian-Frey/Milestone-Project-Two" rel="nofollow">GitHub Repository</a></li>
    <li>At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.</li>
    <li>You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.</li>
</ol> 

<h3>Making a Local Clone</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Log in to GitHub and locate the <a href="https://github.com/Darian-Frey/Milestone-Project-Two" rel="nofollow">GitHub Repository</a></li>
    <li>Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".</li>
    <li>To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.</li>
    <li>Open Git Bash</li>
    <li>Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.<li/>
    Type <code>git clone</code>, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.<br>
    <code>$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY</code></li>
    <li>Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.<br>
    <code>$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY<br>
    > Cloning into `CI-Clone`...<br>
    > remote: Counting objects: 10, done.<br>
    > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.<br>
    > remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)<br>
    > Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.</code></li>
</ol>
