<h2>Design</h2>

<p>Inspiration for the game came from <a href="https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">The Big Bang Theory</a>. In the episode <a href="https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lizard-Spock_Expansion" rel="nofollow">The Lizard-Spock Expansion</a> Sheldon, Raj and Leonard are arguing about what to watch on TV, Raj suggests rock, paper, scissors. Sheldon says there is too much chance of a tie, and suggests Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock.</p>
